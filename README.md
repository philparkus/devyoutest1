Artina M: From this course, I am hoping to get a holistic understanding of the software development life cycle and the agile workflow process. Additionally, I hope to expand my understanding of HTML and CSS, learn new tips and tricks and finally learn JavaScript. I also look forward to gaining experience in what it's like to work with a team within a software development environment.
